  "Jewelleries are designed and made by Henrietta Horv√°th. This series was created during the lockdowns. Although I wasn't fully aware of it at the time, looking back, that period was filled with a lot of creative work.I was constantly photographing and painting.I started to let go of the expectations I had taken on in various institutions.I felt that I couldn't wait any longer, it was now or never, I had to bring out what I could from within myself.That's how these pictures were born.So I was sitting at home thinking about how I should portray these jewelry pieces.I couldn't go out to buy props, I had to use the things I had at home for the photography.Suddenly, I somehow noticed the bouquet I had received as a gift from one of my very kind clients after documenting an event.I started to take apart the completely dried plants and used them to build the compositions.";
